Sprint Review and Retrospective


When reviewing the user needs and interpreting them to implement them into a program, it is essential to create a culture of communication with not only the client, but also with the team. Having a conversation with the client, understanding exactly what it is they are looking for in a program is paramount, but the same can be said for getting feedback from the team as to whether or not their idea is feasible, cost effective, or capabale of being on time.

By approaching my project development, it will be crucial to adhere to the principles of agile. In order to do so, I must approach the project with an open mind, understanding that I need to be flexible in order to adapt to inevitable changes. This coincides with most valuble principle, which is quickly adapting to changes that will occur, and not get bogged down with a project. This aligns with staying on schedule, even if it means having to move past it to begin on the next sprint.

The most important quality a good team member can have is honesty, transparency, and an open line of communication. If a team lacks even on of those qualities, it could lower morale, detach the team from their goals, and even garner a distrust, all of which lower productivity and the ability to produce a quality product.
